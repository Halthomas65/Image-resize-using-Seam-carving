1. In seamCarvingByDevice1, bring convertRgb2GrayKernel out of while loop to get 1 grayscale imgage only.
    Reducing time to make it and delete it. 
    Instead, change removeSeamKernel so that it works on both the original image and the grayscale one.
    ==> Failed
2. Bring filters to device constant memory
    ==> Success
